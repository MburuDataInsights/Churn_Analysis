# Churn_Analysis
# Bank Customer Churn Analysis with ML Decision Trees, Random Forest and XGBoost

This repository contains code and data for performing a customer churn analysis in a bank using machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees and XGBoost. The goal of this analysis is to predict customer churn, which refers to customers who are likely to stop using the bank's services.


## Introduction

In this project, we aim to analyze customer churn in a bank using machine learning algorithms. Customer churn is an important business metric, and predicting churn can help banks take proactive measures to retain customers. We will use two popular machine learning algorithms, decision trees and XGBoost, to build predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains information about bank customers, including various features such as age, gender, account balance, transaction history, etc. It also includes a binary target variable indicating whether a customer has churned or not.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- graphviz (for visualizing decision trees)
